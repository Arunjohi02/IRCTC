            <div class="p20">
                <p>Typically, meals on train journeys are considered bland and uninteresting, which people eat more out of need than out of desire. You can also get meals at any of the stations' many public food stalls. However, to do so will require you to leave your berth and valuables unattended. And also face the risk of missing your train. Moreover, getting hygienic food is always a concern with open stalls & vendors on platforms.</p>

                <p>But IRCTC eCatering delivers fresh, hygienic meals from a range of popular brands & restaurants without compromising taste or affordability. As a result, your journey will be the perfect blend of flavorful indulgence and cosy convenience.</p>
